        "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",

        "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",

        "It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
